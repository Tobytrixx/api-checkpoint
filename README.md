In this program I consumed an API that provides us with list of users.
I created a prject using create-react-app
Created UserList.js file in src folder
Installed axios.
Used jsonplaceholder API to get list of user 
Used axios to Get data from Link inside useEffect hooks
Used UseState hooks to save data into listOfUSer state 
Map listOfUser to display list of user into screen 
Styled my App to my prefernce
To start project npm start in IDE terminal
